# Shell Setup

_"Where there is a shell, there's a way"_

I'm most productive if given a shell, my configs are on [dotfiles](http://github.com/khoi/dotfiles).

- 🐡[Fish](http://fishshell.com/) - "Out Of The Box" shell that's arguably better than zsh

- 🔍[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - fuzzy finder for everything
- 🔌[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - screen multiplexer, long running tasks, tile management, you name it.
- 📖[tldr](https://tldr.sh/) - dead simple man page with examples.
- 💀[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - a better `ack`
- 🐙[hub](https://github.com/github/hub) - a `git` wrapper that allows me to interact with Github from the CLI (creating repo, creating PR)
