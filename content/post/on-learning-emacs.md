## Starting

This post (100% written using emacs) documents the process of me (a vim user) on learning emacs.

- M-x help-with-tutorial 

This takes me around 30 minutes to complete. Feel like default vim key bindings are more natural. Find emacs key bindings awkwards. But C-h is better than Vim

Copy and paste works out of the box with system clipboard

## Trying out doom emacs

After being familiar with the default key bindings, I find it's quite awkward. Heard good things about Doom emacs.

Feel right at home with all the key bindings, now have to explore other emacs mode
