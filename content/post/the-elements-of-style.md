This post is a summarized version of ["The Elements of Style"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) by William Strunk Jr & E.B. White. It serves mostly as a personal references for my future writing.

## I. Elementary Rules of Usage

### 1. Form the posessive singular of nouns by adding 's.

- Khoi's friends

### 2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term ecept the last.

- blue, green, and black
- He sent an email, met a client and headed home.

### 3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.

- Saturday, March 14, 2020

A name or a title in direct address is parenthetic.

- Well, Khoi, you made a mistake there. 

Abbreviations for title, degress that follow a name are parenthetic

- Andrew Smith, Ph.D., presided. 

Nonrestrictive relative clause are parenthetic.

- The code, which is written by Khoi, is utterly garbage.
- The guy, whoever he was, left yesterday.

When the main clause is preceded by a phrase or a subordinate clause, use commas

- Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged their...

### 4. Place a comma before `and` and `but` introducing an independent clause.

- The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.

When the subject is the same for both clauses, and is expressed only once, add a comma if the connective word is `but`

- I have seen ghosts, but am still skeptic.

### 5. Do not join independent clauses with a comma.

If two or more complete clauses are joined to form a single compound sentence WITHOUT conjections, use `;`.

- Khoi's code is mediocre; they are full of bugs.
- It's 11 PM; we can't get home before dark.

If the second clause is preceded by adverb, such as `accordingly`, `besides`, `so`, `therefore`, `thus` and not by a conjunction, the `;` is still required.

- Khoi's code is mediocre; so it is full of bugs.

However, in writing, `so` is generally frowned upon. The above sentence can be rephrased with `as`.

- As Khoi’s code is mediocre, it is full of bugs.

When the clauses are very short, `,` is preferred.

- Man proposes, God disposes.

### 6. Do not break sentences in two.
In other words, do not use periods for commas.

- He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over the world, and lived in half a dozen countries.

The first `.` in the example above should be replaced with `,`.

It is permissible to make an emphatic word or expression serve the purpose of a sentence.

- Again and again he called out. No reply.

### 7. Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive, an amplification, or an illustrative quotation.

- Chicken curry requires 3 ingredients: chicken, curry, and water.

### 8. Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary.

A dash is stronger than a command, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses.

Use a dash only when a more common mark of punctuation seems inadequate.
	
### 9. The number of the subject determines the number of the verb.

Words that intervene between subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb.

- One of those people who are never ready on time.
	
Use a singular verb form after `each`, `either`, `everyone`, `everybody`, `neither`, `nobody`, `someone`. 

- Everybody thinks he sings well.
- Although both clocks strike cheerfully, neither keeps good time.

With `none`, use a singular verb when the word means “no one” or “not one”.

- None of us is perfect.

When `none` suggests more than one thing or person, use plural verb.

- None are so fallible as those who are sure they’re right.

A compound subject formed of two or more nouns joined by `and` almost always require a plural verb.

- The walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand.

Certain compounds are so inseparable they are considered a unit so take a singular verb, as do compound subjects qualified by `each` or `every`.

- The long and the short of it is...
- Give and take is essential to a happy house hold.
- Every window, picture, and mirror was smashed.

A singular subject remains singular if connected to other nouns using `with`, `as well as`, `in addition to`, `except`, `together with`, `no less than`.

- His speech as well as his manner is objectionable.

There are exceptions. Some nouns appear to be plural are usually constructed as singular and given a singular verb.

- Politics is art.

In these cases, one must simply learn the idioms. The contents of a book is singular. The contents of a jar may be either singular or plural.
