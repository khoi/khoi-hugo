This post is a summarized version of ["The Elements of Style"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) by William Strunk Jr & E.B. White. It serves mostly as a personal references for my future writing.

## I. Elementary Rules of Usage

1. Form the posessive singular of nouns by adding 's.

- Khoi's friends

2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term ecept the last.

- blue, green, and black
- He sent an email, met a client and headed home.

3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.

- Saturday, March 14, 2020
- Well, Khoi, you made a mistake there. *- A name or a title in direct address is parenthetic.*
- Andrew Smith, Ph.D., presided. *abbreviations for title, degress that follow a name are parenthetic*

> Nonrestrictive relative clause are parenthetic.

- The code, which is written by Khoi, is utterly garbage.
- The guy, whoever he was, left yesterday.
