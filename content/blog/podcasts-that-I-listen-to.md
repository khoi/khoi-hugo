I usually listen to podcasts on the way to work. These are the ones that I'm personally listen to and enjoy. Hope you guys will like it as well.

### Entertainment Podcasts

* [Serial Season 1 & 2](https://serialpodcast.org/) hosted by Sarah Koenig (superb content, highly recommended)
* [Casefile True Crime](http://casefilepodcast.com/) (not as good as Serial, but worth mentioning)

### Learning And Personal Development Podcasts

* [The Tim Ferriss Show](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/) (Who doesn't know Tim Ferris right?)
* [Coaching for Leaders](http://coachingforleaders.com/) (The content is great, sound quality is top-notch)
* [Stuff you should know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts)

### iOS Development

* [The iPhreaks Show](https://devchat.tv/iphreaks) (This is the only audio podcasts that I found that the content is worth listening to :( suggest me others please)
* [Objc.io Talks](https://talk.objc.io/) (Paid video contents, but it's worth every penny)

It took me ~ an hour to drive from home work, so I've been harkening to every podcasts that releases and sometimes I'm out of content to listen to. I'll definitely checkout other recommended podcasts and keep this post updated as I found something useful.
