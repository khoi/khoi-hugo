I usually listen to podcasts on the way to work. These are the ones that I'm personally listen to and enjoy. Hope you guys will like it as well.

### Entertainment Podcasts

* [Serial Season 1 & 2](https://serialpodcast.org/) hosted by Sarah Koenig (superb content, highly recommended)
* [Casefile True Crime](http://casefilepodcast.com/) (not as good as Serial, but worth mentioning)

### Learning And Personal Development Podcasts

* [Y Combinator](https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/podcast/) A podcast on starting a startup.
* [How I Build This](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this) About entrepreneurs and idealists sharing their journey. 
* [The Tim Ferriss Show](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/) (Who doesn't know Tim Ferriss right?)
* [Coaching for Leaders](http://coachingforleaders.com/) (The content is great, sound quality is top-notch)

### iOS Development

* [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped) - A 30-minute spin off of [Swift Weekly Brief](https://swiftweekly.github.io/)
* [Fatal Error](https://fatalerror.fm/) - Great in-depth iOS development podcast
* [The iPhreaks Show](https://devchat.tv/iphreaks)
* [Objc.io Talks](https://talk.objc.io/) (Paid video contents, but it's worth every penny)

You can import my latest podcasts in the format of [OPML](/others/overcast.opml) using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/).

I use it as my daily podcast driver. The `Smart Speed Silence Shortener` feature is super amazing, definitely check it out..
