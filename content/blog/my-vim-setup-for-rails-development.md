![Vim Tmux on Rails](/images/vim_tmux_on_rails.png)

Vim has recently become my editor of choice for code editting, especially for Ruby. I spent half of my time in the Tmux/Vim environment, and the other half is on Xcode. 

In this blog post, I am going to share my Rails development workflow, the plugins that I use, and some general useful Vim tips that hopefully everyone can make use of.
